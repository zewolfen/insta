- I did not used kubernetes  before but i did the following 
- First i followed the Dockerized link to make sure that every thing is working, and got ruby on localhost:8000
- then i installed  kubernetes, kubectl
- then i installed minikube following the fedora magazine steps https://fedoramagazine.org/minikube-kubernetes/ on my fedora laptop
- then installed VBOX to start minikube cluster 
- then installed kompose to migrate from docer-compose to kubernetes, kompose --file docker-compose.yml convert
- i got some errors so i did some researches and did some changes on the docker compose file by adding the version and image tags,
- Got stuck at the configmaps parts as i did not have enough time to do the researches as i have got some projects at work plus i was preparing for 
a giving a devops speach at the greek campus
